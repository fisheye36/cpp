// exercise 4.1

/**
 *
 * Write a C++ program that requests and displays information as shown in the following
 * example of output:
 *
 * What is your first name? Betty Sue
 * What is your last name? Yewe
 * What letter grade do you deserve? B
 * What is your age? 22
 *
 * Name: Yewe, Betty Sue
 * Grade: C
 * Age: 22
 *
 * Note that the program should be able to accept first names that comprise more
 * than one word. Also note that the program adjusts the grade downward - that is, up
 * one letter. Assume that the user requests an A, a B, or a C so that you donâ€™t have to
 * worry about the gap between a D and an F.
