/**
 *
 * Write a program that reads input a word at a time until a lone q is entered. The
 * program should then report the number of words that began with vowels, the number
 * that began with consonants and the number that fit neither of those categories.
 * One approach is to use isalpha() to discriminate between words beginning with
 * letters and those that donâ€™t and then use an if or switch statement to further identify
 * those passing the isalpha() test that begin with vowels. A sample run might
 * look like this:
 *
 * Enter words (q to quit):
 * The 12 awesome oxen ambled
 * quietly across 15 meters of lawn. q
 *
 * 5 words beginning with vowels.
 * 4 words beginning with consonants.
 * 2 others.
