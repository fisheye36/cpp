/**
 *
 * You sell the book C++ for Fools. Write a program that has you enter a yearâ€™s worth
 * of monthly sales (in terms of number of books, not of money). The program should
 * use a loop to prompt you by month, using an array of char * (or an array of
 * string objects, if you prefer) initialized to the month strings and storing the input
 * data in an array of int. Then, the program should find the sum of the array contents
 * and report the total sales for the year.
